# NEXT STEPS: ratelord Phase 1

1. [ ] **Orchestrator review pass**: Re-read `VISION.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONSTRAINTS.md` for terminology alignment (constraint graph, pool, scope, identity) and remove any contradictions.
2. [ ] **Sub-Agent assignment**: Delegate drafting of `IDENTITIES.md` (identity taxonomy + ownership + sharing semantics).
3. [ ] **Sub-Agent assignment**: Delegate drafting of `DATA_MODEL.md` (event types + projection model, consistent with ARCHITECTURE).
4. [ ] **Update tracking**: Reflect new in-flight docs in `PROGRESS.md` and append decisions/open questions to `PHASE_LEDGER.md` if needed.
