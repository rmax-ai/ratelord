# NEXT_STEPS: User Documentation & Quality Assurance

## Current Context
- **Documentation**: Drafted core user guides (`concepts/architecture.md`, `concepts/core-model.md`, `reference/api.md`).
- **Phase 16 (QA)**: Test coverage goals met for API/Store/Engine.
- **Phase 14 & 15**: Complete.

## Immediate Actions
- [x] **Review Documentation**: Verify the newly created user docs in `docs/` align with the implementation and are clear.
- [x] **M42.4 (Audit)**: Updated `docs/index.md` to link all guides (`web-ui.md`, `cli.md`) and verified `docs/installation.md` and `docs/configuration.md`.
- [x] **M42.5 (Improvement)**: Enhanced `docs/installation.md`, switched to YAML in `docs/configuration.md` & `docs/guides/deployment.md`, and implemented YAML support in `pkg/engine`.
- [x] **M42.3 (Refined)**: Added Policy Guide and moved/refined Deployment Guide.
- [x] **SDK Docs**: Refreshed JS, Python, and Go SDK documentation to remove draft warnings and match implementation.
- [ ] **Phase 16 Continues**: Run advanced simulation scenarios (Epic 28) or focus on release prep.

## Phase History
- [x] **M42.1, M42.2, M42.3**: User Documentation (Concepts, API Ref, Guides).
- [x] **M41.3: Engine Package Coverage** (Achieved 80.9%).
