# NEXT STEPS: Phase 4 - Implementation & Verification

The TUI Dashboard (Epic 8) and Policy Engine are now stabilized, providing visibility into the system state and enforcing rules. The core implementation phase is largely complete. The next steps involve verifying the full system behavior.

## Current Objective: Full System Verification

The system components are stabilized. Now we need to verify full system behavior.

### Tasks for Next Session:

1.  **M10.2: Verification of Drift Detection**

2.  **M10.3: Verification of Policy Enforcement**

3.  **M10.4: Final Acceptance Run**
